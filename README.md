# Tanour

Tanour is a Contract actor executor for [Pactus](https://pactus.org/) blockchain.

## Features

### Standalone and stateless

Tanour can be launched as an independent and standalone process and it has no internal state.
Interacting with the Pactus blockchain happens through the set of Provider APIs.

### Actor model

Contract in Pactus are like Actors in the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).

Each contract actor:
 - Can be instantiated through the `instantiate` method.
 - Can process the message it receives through `process` method.
 - Can concurrently send a message to another contract actor through the `send_msg` method.

These are the only methods that each contract can expose to the outside world.

### Storage as file

Pactus storage is not a typical key-value pair system, but rather a separate file that each contract actor has read and write access to. Pactus storage offers a unique way of managing data in a distributed environment.

**Storage as key-value pairs**
